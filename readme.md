# FPGA to HPS data transfer projects

## Overview

Projects for the DE10-Nano development board (Intel Cyclone V SoC FPGA) to test data transfers from FPGA to HPS.

## Results

The highest that I managed to get are these transfer throughput results:
- F2H bridge + ACP, 128-bit, 200MHz, 128MB: **775.01 MB/s**
- F2S interface, 256-bit, 200MHz, 256MB: **1782.62 MB/s**

For more results see the Excel file in the results folder.
