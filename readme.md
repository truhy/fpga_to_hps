# FPGA to HPS data transfer projects

## Overview

Projects for the DE10-Nano development board (Intel Cyclone V SoC FPGA) to test data transfers from FPGA to HPS.

## Data buses

The Cyclone V contains two types of data buses, ACP (FPGA-to-HPS + ACP cache support) and F2S (FPGA-to-SDRAM).
Each bus is tested by a separate project, located inside a folder.
